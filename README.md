This is what I'm buiding out today.
I'm usuing my IAM user
My t2.micro EC2 instance hosting my Web app.
I've installed Java and Maven on the Instance.
and connecting my Github repo to that EC2 instance to make changes and deploy the code instantly, using a unique token!
I was able to make changes to the code base and see them update in GitHUb after doing a push in real time!

## Introduction
This project is used for an introduction to creating and deploying a Java-based web app using AWS, especially their CI/CD tools.
* I Am doign this project to better learn this developement and deployment process so I may work effectovely wiht development teams.
* It is one of the most asked for skills on cloud engineer job posting

The deployment pipeline I'm building around the Java web app in this repository is invisible to the end-user, but makes a big impact by automating the software release processes.

<br>

## Technologies
Here’s what I’m using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: I'm developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers, so that software development and deployment happens entirely on the cloud.
- **VSCode**: For my IDE, I chose Visual Studio Code. It connects directly to my development EC2 instance, making it easy to edit code and manage files in the cloud.
- **GitHub**: All my web app code is stored and versioned in this GitHub repository.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeArtifact**: Once it's rolled out, CodeArtifact will store my artifacts and dependencies, which is great for high availability and speeding up my project's build process.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeBuild**: Once it's rolled out, CodeBuild will take over my build process. It'll compile the source code, run tests, and produce ready-to-deploy software packages automatically.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeDeploy**: Once it's rolled out, CodeDeploy will automate my deployment process across EC2 instances.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodePipeline**: Once it's rolled out, CodePipeline will automate the entire process from GitHub to CodeDeploy, integrating build, test, and deployment steps into one efficient workflow.
