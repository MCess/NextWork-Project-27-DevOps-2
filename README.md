This is what I'm buiding out today.
I'm usuing my IAM user
My t2.micro EC2 instance hosting my Web app.
I've installed Java and Maven on the Instance.
and connecting my Github repo to that EC2 instance to make changes and deploy the code instantly, using a unique token!
I was able to make changes to the code base and see them update in GitHUb after doing a push in real time!
